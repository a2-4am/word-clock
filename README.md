Word Clock is a fuzzy time display program for 8-bit Apple ][ computers. It runs on any Apple ][ with 64K. It can be copied to a ProDOS hard drive if you like that sort of thing. [Download the latest Word Clock disk image](https://github.com/a2-4am/word-clock/releases/tag/v1.0) (version **1.0**, released **2022-08-16**) or [try it online](https://archive.org/details/WordClock4am).

Word Clock updates every minute with a phrase that represents the current time. Of course, knowing the current time requires a clock, which not all Apple ][ models have. Word Clock uses standard ProDOS calls, so any clock card or chip with a ProDOS driver should be recognized. If your Apple ][ does not have a clock, Word Clock will go into demo mode and slowly cycle through all the possible phrases.
